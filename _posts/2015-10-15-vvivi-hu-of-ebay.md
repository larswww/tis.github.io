On today’s show, I was honoured to have the chance to speak with Vvivi Hu, Chief Strategy Officer for Ebay Greater China. Vvivi is also an Angel Investor through the AngelVest group, a former entrepreneur, a Harvard grad, and a soon-to-be published author. I invited Vvivi on the show so she could share with us her perspective on the role of quote-unquote ‘grandfather’ technology companies in the current ecosystem, and soon realized I would be getting much more! Vvivi had some fascinating insights on the differences between Chinese and western tech entrepreneurs, some very practical advice for pitching Angel Investors, and tops it all off with a few words of wisdom from her new book on how to build HABITS for a healthy, productive and balanced life. I thoroughly enjoyed my chat with Vvivi, and hopefully you will too!
