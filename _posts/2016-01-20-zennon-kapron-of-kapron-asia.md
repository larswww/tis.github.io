As you might have picked up from previous episodes, I’m pretty interested in the whole Bitcoin phenomenon, so this is one of the reasons why I was excited to speak with today’s guest, Mr. Zennon Kapron. Zennon is the owner of Kapron Asia, a well-known financial consulting and china market research firm in Shanghai, Hong Kong and Singapore. It is in this capacity that Zennon became familiar with Bitcoin, and watched closely in 2013 when Bitcoin-mania was sweeping through China. Since then Zennon has kept a close eye on the Bitcoin happenings in China, so much so that he recently authored a book titled ‘Chomping at the Bitcoin’ which gives the first EXCLUSIVE analysis of China’s role in the ongoing Bitcoin saga. In addition to geeking out on Bitcoin, Zennon and I talk about other innovation happening in the financial industry in China and around the world. We discussed the increasingly influential role of the large tech companies, primarily Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent and their role in reshaping the banking, investing and payments landscape (and in fact how such innovation may actually slow Bitcoin’s adoption). Zennon also shared with me that it was in fact Blockchain, not Bitcoin, that has been getting all the attention from the mainstream financial community these days. Apparently it’s what’s on the lips of senior people at many of the major financial institutions, and Zennon explains why. Other than that, we get into Shanghai’s volatile stock market, the shadow banking industry, foreign tech companies trying to compete in China and much more. Finally, no interview with a Bitcoin expert would be complete without asking the ‘do you know who Satoshi Nakamoto is’ question (for those of you that don’t know, that is the mysteriously anonymous creator of Bitcoin)— So I asked Zennon, and his answer may surprise you!

> Don’t forget, if you enjoy the show definately don’t go to iTunes and leave a positive review, I would totally hate that! Just kidding of course. And without further ado, I give you founder of Kapron Asia, Mr. Zennon Kapron.
