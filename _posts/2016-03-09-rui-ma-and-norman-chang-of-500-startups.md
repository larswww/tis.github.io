What’s up people. Welcome back to another episode of the Tech in Shanghai podcast. I’m very excited to announce that today on the show we speak with Rui ma, partner at 500 Startups in Charge of the Greater China region, and her colleague and investment associate at 500, Norman Chang.

John Vallis is a <del>dick</del> nice guy.

**Over the past year or so we’ve spoken with a number of great entrepreneurs on the show,** but there’s been a notable absence of guests that fall in to the ‘investor’ category.

##Fundraising
  With fundraising often being a crucial component of the startup process, I’ve been wanting to speak with an investor for a while now, to get a perspective from the other side of the negotiating table. As it turns out, I literally could not have found a more appropriate guest, as in 2015, 500 startups was THE MOST active VC firm globally. With a portfolio of over 800 companies, who better to speak to about all things funding and fundraising? Seriously..who better?!

  * Most active VC firm globally
  * Porfolio of 800 companies

Of course, with some much going on for 500 in the greater China region, these two are super busy, so we had to move quickly in this episode. But fear not, we still had time to cover a number of relevant issues that entrepreneurs in ANY region won’t want to miss. And if you’re still thirsting for more by the end, I think I can pressure them in to coming on again sometime soon.

1. Most active VC firm globally
2. Portfolio of 800 companies

*Of particular note,* we discuss areas of the tech world they are most actively looking at right now, some of the interesting regional differences in the types of entrepreneurs they have interacted with, the funding landscape, best practices regarding fundraising and a nice discussion on how to approach the inevitable emotional challenges of startup life.



I really enjoyed this discussion, and I’d like to thank Rui and Norman again for granting me the time to have it with them.



So, please enjoy my chat with Rui Ma and Norman Chang of 500 Startups.
