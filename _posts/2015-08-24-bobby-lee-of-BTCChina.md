In this episode we speak with Bobby Lee, Co-founder and CEO of BTC China, one of the world’s largest and most trusted Bitcoin exchanges (and more as it turns out!).

Bitcoin is an extremely hot topic in the tech world today, and though many have extremely high hopes for it, still others remain confused about how to get it, use it, and how significant of a technology it truly is.

We discuss the history of Bitcoin, why it is so revolutionary, and why understanding it (and potentially other ‘cryptocurrencies’) will be an important component of managing your finances as we move further into the digital age!
